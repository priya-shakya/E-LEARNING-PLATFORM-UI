The project titled LearnPro is a front-end user interface for an E-Learning platform, designed to deliver online educational content and track learner progress. The concept behind LearnPro is to provide users a digital space where they can access a wide range of online courses, view educational videos, and monitor their learning achievements anytime, anywhere. Built using core front-end technologies like HTML5 and CSS3, this project reflects a modern and accessible layout for educational platforms.
This platform is structured as a multi-page website with a clean and intuitive navigation system, enabling learners to easily move between the Home, Courses, and Progress sections. The website begins with a header section that includes the platform name LearnPro and a responsive navigation bar linking to key pages. This header is designed for quick access and visibility across all pages, improving overall user experience.
The next section is a hero banner that captures user attention upon visiting the homepage. This hero section features a welcoming heading ‚ÄúLearn Anytime, Anywhere‚Äù and a brief introductory message about the platform‚Äôs offerings. It also includes a prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) button labeled "Browse Courses," which directs users to the courses page, encouraging engagement and exploration.
A major feature of the LearnPro platform is its Featured Courses Section. This section highlights selected courses that users might find valuable, displayed within neatly styled course cards. Each course card includes:

A course title (e.g., ‚ÄúHTML & CSS Beginner Tutorial‚Äù)
An embedded YouTube video for instant content preview
A View Details button, which can be linked to a detailed course description page.
For embedding course videos, the project utilizes YouTube‚Äôs iframe embed functionality, allowing seamless video integration directly on the platform without the need for heavy back-end infrastructure. Videos are embedded responsively within each course card, making sure they adapt to various screen sizes.
The layout for the featured courses uses a CSS Flexbox-based grid system (as implemented in the linked CSS file styles.css), ensuring that the course cards align evenly on larger screens and stack neatly on smaller devices. The color scheme, typography, and spacing are consistently styled to provide a clean, distraction-free environment conducive to online learning.
At the bottom of the webpage lies the footer section, containing copyright information and developer acknowledgment.

üìå Tools and Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the entire webpage and organizing content sections logically using semantic elements.
CSS3: For styling, layout design, colors, typography, responsiveness, and making the user interface aesthetically appealing.
YouTube Embed (iframe): To integrate video-based course content directly within the course listing.
Text Editor (like Visual Studio Code): For writing and managing the code files
Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge): For testing and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
